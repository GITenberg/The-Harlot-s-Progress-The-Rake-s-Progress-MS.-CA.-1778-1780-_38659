<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="indent">The prints and engraved sequences of William Hogarth
(1697-1764) inspired a wide range of dramatic entertainments
throughout the eighteenth century. The types include comedy
of manners (<i>The Clandestine Marriage</i>, 1766), burletta with
<i>tableau vivant</i> (<i>Ut Pictura Poesis!</i> 1789), specialty act (<i>A
Modern Midnight Conversation</i>, 1742), cantata (<i>The Roast
Beef of Old England</i>, ca. 1759), ballad opera (<i>The Decoy</i>),<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
pantomime (<i>The Jew Decoy'd</i> and <i>The Harlot's Progress</i>, 1733),
and a morality ballad opera (<i>The Rake's Progress</i>, ca. 1778-1780).
Two of these are reprinted here. Theophilus Cibber's
&quot;Grotesque Pantomime Entertainment&quot; of Hogarth's six-scene
series &quot;A Harlot's Progress&quot; (1732), entitled <i>THE HARLOT'S
PROGRESS</i>; or The Ridotto Al'Fresco,&quot; was first published 31
March 1733 for its Drury Lane debut as an afterpiece.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Less
familiar is the anonymous &quot;Dramatised Version&quot; of Hogarth's
eight-print sequence &quot;A Rake's Progress&quot; (1735), British
Library Add. MS. 25997, entitled The Rake's Progress.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Of critical interest in looking at the engravings along with
the dramas they inspired is the evidence provided of significant
visual-verbal reciprocities in the period. In particular, it shows
one aspect of the interrelationship operative between (1)
creation of the prints, with the artist often relying perceptibly
on dramatic literature and theatrical sets,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and (2) inspiration
from print to theater, as playwrights generated new stage
pieces based on the graphic works. Moreover, these two
dramas underscore the importance of music in eighteenth century
theater where the use of songs in pantomimes and new
lyrics for old tunes in ballad opera were alike commonplace by
mid-century.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The plays lend support to Bertrand Bronson's observation
that, in an age which &quot;thought Man the proper study
of Mankind,&quot; it is not surprising that the &quot;major emphasis (and
accomplishment) in music should be dramatic and, in a broad
sense, social.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These dramas add visual and musical insights
to literary concerns of the time.</p>

<p class="indent">In &quot;A Harlot's Progress&quot; (1732) Hogarth's six prints
recount a few years in the young life of &quot;M. Hackabout&quot; from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageii" id="pageii"></a>[pg ii]</span>
her innocent arrival in London (from Yorkshire) through
debauchery, prostitution, and theft to death from venereal
disease at the age of 23. Hogarth's engraved sequence shows
about 12 characters, including Moll's child and supernumerary
harlots at her funeral. The stage piece by Colley Cibber's son
entitled <i>The Harlot's Progress</i> consists solely of stage directions
and verses set to six &quot;Airs.&quot; It has 27 characters, including
a &quot;little Harlequin Dog.&quot; The harlot's new name,
&quot;Kitty,&quot; probably refers to the actress (Mrs. Raftor, later Kitty
Clive) who initially played this role. The music for the songs
seems to be lost, though many tunes can be identified.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Furthermore,
Roger Fiske reports that later in 1733 this work was offered
at Bartholomew Fair with a band that included &quot;oboes,
bassoons, horns, trumpets, drums and strings.&quot; Though traditionally
<i>The Harlot's Progress</i> has been treated as pantomime,
Fiske considers it a &quot;mixture of masque, ballad opera and
pantomime.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Actually Cibber's piece, with its concluding
&quot;Masque,&quot; more closely fits Paul Sawyer's definition of pantomime
as &quot;a mixture of comic (sometimes called grotesque)
elements&quot; concerning the love adventures and misadventures
of Harlequin and Columbine, &quot;largely in dumb show,&quot; but &quot;occasionally
interspersed with songs and dances.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In addition,
Sawyer notes, there is a &quot;serious part,&quot; usually drawn from
mythology, featuring dancing, recitative, song, and some
dialogue. In the present case, this would be the masque of &quot;The
Judgment of Paris&quot; which concludes <i>The Harlot's Progress</i> (p.
12).</p>

<p class="indent">On the stage, Cibber shifts the Hogarthian tone from an
ineluctable moral formula (the wages of sin equal death) to one
that transforms social and moral punishment into lyrical
pageantry. To accomplish this, he uses the mechanical humor
of harlequinade and omits three grim occasions portrayed by
Hogarth: Hackabout's apprehension by Sir John Gonson in a
garret (Pl. 4), her early death from venereal disease (Pl. 5), and
her funeral with its morally dubious mourners (Pl. 6). Cibber
replaces the potential moral commentary of these three prints
with stage antics and dance. Cibber's harlot &quot;Kitty&quot; is sent to
Bridewell like Hogarth's Moll Hackabout (Pl. 4), but her
punishment there turns magically into a dance.</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;Keeper&quot; forces her and other women to beat hemp,
but the blocks suddenly disappear; in their stead appear her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii" id="pageiii"></a>[pg iii]</span>
lover Harlequin, with Scaramouch and others, and all &quot;dance
off&quot; to the &quot;Ridotto al'Fresco,&quot; while the Keeper &quot;runs away
frighted.&quot; The threat of punishment vanishes with the blocks.
At the &quot;Ridotto,&quot; in a stage set depicting a Vauxhall scene, people
appear in masquerade, and a grand &quot;Comic Ballad&quot; is performed
to various musical tunes. But this is not the end of the
pantomime, for yet to come is &quot;The Judgment of Paris,&quot; John
Weaver's &quot;Dramatic Entertainment&quot; after the &quot;Manner of the
Ancient Greeks and Romans,&quot; which had premiered in
February 1733.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Though he was quite consciously imitating Hogarth's
&quot;Celebrated Designs,&quot; Cibber's directions do not specify that
costuming duplicate Hogarth's contemporary London figures
such as the notorious Mother Needham, Colonel Charteris (Pl.
1), Justice Gonson (Pl. 4), or the quarreling doctors Misaubin
and Rock at Moll's deathbed (Pl. 5).<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In addition to changing
the name &quot;M. Hackabout&quot; to &quot;Kitty&quot; the &quot;Country Girl,&quot; Cibber
dubs his Charteris character &quot;Old Debauchee,&quot; Needham
&quot;Madame Decoy,&quot; and the Jew who keeps Kitty, &quot;Beau Mordecai.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The comic element asserts itself in the first stage scene as
Harlequin hides in Kitty's trunk and then disguises himself as a
cadet, imitating Hackabout's lover in Hogarth's second print.
During this stage trick, Madame Decoy sings new verses to an
eighteenth century ballad celebrating the innocent beauties of
rural poverty (Air I, &quot;What tho' I am a Country Lass&quot;). Clearly,
audiences familiar with the more biting pictorial scenes of a
harlot's life would be easily diverted, even relieved, by the
elaborate mixture of Greek and Italian elements, and the
flourish of songs in the parodic ballad opera tradition. Cibber
of course capitalized on the occasion, popularity, and
familiarity of Hogarth's six prints in 1733, but his theatrical
realization clarifies the quality of pantomimic entertainment
with its numerous contemporary graphic allusions, revealing
an aborted moral embellished by a splay of music and masque.</p>

<p class="indent">Theophilus Cibber's entertainment was quite successful
on the London stage, having a good run at the patent theaters
and the fairs in 1733 and for a while thereafter.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Furthermore,
it is related to an important event in Drury Lane history. Cibber
seceded with a group of actors in May of 1733 from that theater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv"></a>[pg iv]</span>
because of management disputes. After playing at the fairs, the
protesting actors performed at the Little Theatre in the
Haymarket until the spring of 1734 when they returned to
Drury Lane. In a letter to patentee John Highmore, Cibber
wrote of the <i>Harlot's Progress</i>: &quot;This entertainment (for which
I am indebted to Mr. Hogarth's designs) the Town were pleased
to approve of and encourage.&quot; But, he adds, it might have been
performed &quot;three months sooner than it was, but for the Obstructions
I met with from my Partners.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This theatrical
quarrel created much public discussion in the first decade of
the century (<i>LS</i>, 3, 1, &quot;Introduction,&quot; <i>passim</i>). Hogarth included
in his print &quot;Southwark Fair&quot; (which came out after August
1733) a showcloth of John Laguerre's engraving &quot;The Stage
Mutiny,&quot; a print that in turn had been inspired by the actors'
secession. Hogarth's additions to the Laguerre print demonstrate
his close touch with these events (<i>HGW</i>, I, 156-7).<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> <i>The
Harlot's Progress</i> provides us with a good example of
the genre &quot;Grotesque Pantomime,&quot; and throws much light on
the London stage entertainment stream of an evening that included
Hogarth, harlequin, Venus and Paris, as well as dancing
and singing.</p>

<p class="indent">Hogarth's eight prints of &quot;A Rake's Progress&quot; of 1735<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> provided
the subject&mdash;the rise and fall of a libertine&mdash;for a
morality ballad opera more than forty years later. The 15-scene
stage piece, entitled <i>The Rake's Progress</i>, elaborates visually
and musically the formula: follow virtue and avoid vice. The
author clearly counted on audience familiarity with the graphic
scenes many years after their appearance, and on an increased
receptivity to explicit moralizing. This manuscript was submitted
by the unknown playwright to Drury Lane sometime between
September 1778 and June 1780. The possible date is most
clearly focused in the Sheridans' joint management. Richard
assumed the management in 1776 and held it to at least 1809,
but his father Thomas managed it with his son only for the
seasons 1778-1779 and 1779-1780.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> I think it is therefore
possible to suggest a date for the manuscript between September
1778 when Thomas Sheridan came to Drury Lane, and the
end of the 1779-1780 theatrical season, when he left at the age
of 61.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The piece was not performed.</p>

<p class="indent">Like the Cibber work, the text consists of stage directions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagev" id="pagev"></a>[pg v]</span>
and songs. Allusions to Hogarth appear in title, characters, plot,
and specific scenes. Moreover, a &quot;transparency&quot; introduces the
artist in a literal stage portrait. This device praises Hogarth and
reminds the audience of the graphic correspondences in
dramatic form to come.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Rake's Progress</i> makes significant changes in the content
of Hogarth's series, expanding characters and scenes, and
altering the denouement somewhat from madness to suicide.
New elements of music and clowning change his lugubrious
didacticism to a lyrical warning in a form I call &quot;morality
ballad opera.&quot; The morality and masque features appear in
such characters as &quot;Virtue&quot; and &quot;Vice&quot; who frame the piece,
and &quot;Liberty&quot; and &quot;Benevolence&quot; who descend and ascend on a
cloud, at the end taking Virtue with them. Not included in the
theater version is Hogarth's depiction of the harsh realities of
Bethlehem Hospital, or Bedlam, where spectators pay to gawk
at the inmates, and where Rakewell's libertine journey ends
dismally (Pl. 8). On the boards, the didacticism is even more
emphatic. Rakewell shoots himself to background music which
slows in tempo until it is &quot;render'd as dismal as possible&quot; and
Virtue proclaims a triumph over the demonstrated &quot;baneful influence
of Vice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In &quot;A Rake's Progress&quot; (1735), Hogarth depicts an inverse
relationship between morality and the misuse of money. In the
first of the eight prints, young Tom Rakewell inherits wealth
from his miserly father and misspends it for the remainder of
his life in copying the lifestyle of an aristocrat. His moral
poverty is evident as he offers money to the mother of pregnant
Sarah Young, his former girlfriend, who stands disconsolately
poising a wedding ring. Letters containing his false promises to
her clarify the situation. Material wealth is the cornerstone of
this series as we next see the rake being measured by a tailor
for new clothes while a lawyer pilfers cash; and an upholsterer's
hammering to ready the room for mourning results in a
shower of previously hidden gold coins (Pl. 1). The levee (Pl. 2)
shows Rakewell in a fashionable morning gown, courted by a
gardener, huntsman, and others, while a list of gifts from the
nobility to opera star Farinelli includes a snuff box from Rakewell.
His nocturnal taste shows in the Rose Tavern where he
carouses and is himself raked by harlots (Pl. 3). As part of this
debauched ambiance, a pregnant woman sings the bawdy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a>[pg vi]</span>
ballad &quot;Black Joke.&quot; In daylight, the faithful Sarah saves
Rakewell from street arrest while a group of gamblers fills out
the visual exposition of the rake's dissipation (Pl. 4). Saved by
the middle class girl he ruined, Rakewell next weds a rich
widow to recoup his losses. Sarah, her mother, and Rakewell's
infant offspring unsuccessfully try to abort this clandestine
wedding (Pl. 5). Rakewell's marriage of convenience cannot
meet his needs, and he soon rails despairingly in a Covent Garden
gambling house (Pl. 6). The juggernaut of vice presses on
as he is jailed for debt in Fleet Street prison where he runs up
more bills. A prisoner drops a &quot;Scheme for paying y<sup>e</sup> Debts of
y<sup>e</sup> Nation&quot; to the floor as Sarah faints away and Rakewell's
wife scolds (Pl. 7). The social nadir of Bedlam illumines darkly
Rakewell's last loss&mdash;his reason&mdash;and this graphic anti-progress
concludes, as it began, with Sarah's sorrow (Pl. 8).</p>

<p class="indent">What did the playwright do with Hogarth's harsh comment
on the misappropriation of inherited wealth? He seems to have
enhanced entertainment values and emphasized instruction at
the same time. The drama embellishes the series by (a) adding
stage links only imaginable by spectators of the print sequences,
(b) framing the progress with a morality masque starring
Virtue and Vice, and (c) replacing Hogarth's serious ironic
tone with slapstick and songs drawn from stage musical fare,
such as the burletta <i>Poor Vulcan!</i> by Charles Dibdin, which
premiered in February 1778 (<i>LS</i>, 5, I, 109). Basically, Hogarth's
eight prints of 1735 are transformed in part into a series of
<i>tableaux vivants</i> which served, with variations, in the late
1770's as strong visual reminders for an audience already
familiar with the original pictorial sequence.</p>

<p class="indent">For example, directions for the second scene attempt to put
on the boards the initial print, adding music and slapstick as
&quot;money from the raftor falls into Clown's mouth.&quot; The play invites
the spectator to follow Sarah and her mother after they
leave Rakewell and listen to their duet, sung to the music of Air
I of <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>. The lyrics change, so that Peachum's
cynical comment &quot;Through all the employments of life/Each
neighbor abuses his brother&quot; becomes &quot;His vows, ah! Why
did'st thou believe?/He ne'er meant a promise to keep,&quot; with
the new association of Sarah's being cast off by Rakewell.</p>

<p class="indent">The drama closely follows the series for the rake's levee,
where professionals &quot;pay Court&quot; to Rakewell. A new character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii" id="pagevii"></a>[pg vii]</span>
&quot;Van Butchel,&quot; who sings in dialect, is added. The opportunism
of those proffering services to the young man becomes clear in
their musical medley when they announce they will &quot;plunder
him as fast as we can agree.&quot; At the Rose Tavern, stage directions
for Rakewell state &quot;the actor must let his intoxication
gradually increase.&quot; Before Rakewell's arrest, the bailiff sings a
solo. Sarah saves her lover, as in the sequence, but a small
revelation of his character not in the print marks the incident:
he &quot;kisses her hand&quot; before returning to his sedan chair.</p>

<p class="indent">The stage piece exploits the potential emotional element in
such gestures to the point of sentimentality. For instance,
Sarah's lament following Rakewell's marriage to the rich &quot;Old
Woman&quot; shows grief driving her to despair; she sings &quot;The
Grave will extinguish my woes/Then Sarah&mdash;prepare thee to
die&quot; to the music of the seventeenth century ballad tune
&quot;Mary's Lamentation.&quot; The drama also exploits the sensational
as the smoking fire in a Covent Garden gambling house
(Hogarth's Pl. 5) becomes a public catastrophe with fire
engines and furniture being carried into the street and &quot;Confusion
kept up as long as necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the jail scene, the rake turns out of his breeches a
&quot;Scheme to Pay the National Debt,&quot; a specific verbal echo of
the Fleet Street print, and the prisoners sing a familiar tune
(&quot;Welcome, Brother Debtor&quot;) as musical background to his off-stage
suicide. Then Virtue returns to ascend with &quot;Liberty and
Benevolence&quot; on a cloud, able to relax now that Vice's influence
has run its destructive course.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Rake's Progress</i> is an essentially uneven dramatic
work. The playwright colors the didacticism of Hogarth's
prints with music and farce, yet underscores it by adding Virtue
and Vice and the melodrama of Rakewell's suicide and
Sarah's probable death. The author capitalizes on the suspense
of choice, characteristic of the morality play, by dramatizing it
in conflicts between Vice and Virtue. Yet the effect remains unbalanced.
This palpable form of Hogarth's visual satire loses
much of its impact without a balance of serious, comic, and
musical ingredients. Furthermore, the musical elements are so
haphazardly distributed that they often contribute to a patchwork
effect, as when the bailiff sings a solo prior to making an
arrest.</p>

<p class="indent">Although <i>The Rake's Progress</i> purports to imitate Hogarth's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a>[pg viii]</span>
&quot;Comedy,&quot; where a &quot;biginning, middle &amp; an End/ Are Aptly
join'd; where parts on parts depend,/ Each made for each, as
Bodies for their Soul,&quot; the 15 scenes alternate too erratically
between humor and melodrama to convey the artistic unity and
moral conviction evident in the pictorial sequence. But this
stage piece does demonstrate the persistence of Hogarth's
visual presence in later eighteenth-century life along with the
adaptability of his graphic scenes for the London theater.</p>

<p class="indent">Clearly Theophilus Cibber's comical, lyrical exploitation
in <i>The Harlot's Progress</i> of Hogarth's designs exhibits a more
coherent dramatic structure than the tentative, disjointed
medley of music and moralism in <i>The Rake's Progress</i>. Further,
Cibber's piece adds literary insight to our concept of the hardly
dumb genre of pantomime, with its musical and masque components.
The added melodrama and sentimentality in <i>The
Rake's Progress</i> can help to index theatrical taste in the later
period. For students of the century, both works demonstrate
clearly an aspect of the reliance on Hogarth's art by playwrights.
They also show the flexibility of the London stage in
the use of elements of music and dance to link separate print
scenes, and so attempt a bridge between the forms of art and
drama. These two examples of the lively interplay operative
between stage and print in the early and late decades heighten
appreciation of the expectancies of cultural experiences of different
audiences in the eighteenth century.</p>

<h3>THE TUNES</h3>

<p class="indent"><i>The Harlot's Progress</i> and <i>The Rake's Progress</i> are alike
interesting for the parodic ballad opera pattern of setting new
words to familiar tunes. Though neither work includes the
music, some songs indicate familiar melodies such as &quot;Let us
take the road&quot; from <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>. In <i>The Harlot's Progress</i>,
the six &quot;Airs&quot; come from varied sources, with new lyrics
by Theophilus Cibber. Of the approximately 24 unnumbered
tunes and catches in <i>The Rake's Progress</i>, the most outstanding
in connection with the print sequence is &quot;Black Joke,&quot; Richard
Leveridge's bawdy tune shown by Hogarth in the Rose Tavern
print being sung by a pregnant woman (Pl. 5). In the stage
piece, this song is part of a medley sung to Rakewell by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix" id="pageix"></a>[pg ix]</span>
various professionals who compete for his money. The most
important tunes are those from <i>Poor Vulcan!</i> the burletta by
Charles Dibdin (February 1778), supporting my 1778-1780 date
for <i>The Rake's Progress</i> manuscript.</p>

<p class="indent">The sources used to trace the musical airs include Claude
Simpson's <i>The British Broadside Ballad and Its Music</i> (New
Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1966); Minnie Sears'
<i>Song Index</i> (and <i>Supplement</i>) (New York: Wilson Company,
1926 and 1934); Edythe N. Backus: <i>Catalogue of Music Printed
Before 1801</i> (San Marino, Cal.: The Huntington Library, 1949),
and William Barclay Squire, &quot;An Index of Tunes in the Ballad-Operas,&quot;
<i>The Musical Antiquary</i>, II (October 1910), 1-17.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> E. V.
Roberts points out that &quot;the lack of a ballad designation for a
ballad-opera air usually means that the tune in question was
composed specially for that ballad opera&quot; and that, because
most &quot;unnamed tunes were unknown outside their ballad
operas,&quot; they were &quot;neither copied nor printed, and simply do
not turn up in the collections.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The catches in <i>The Rake's
Progress</i> are not traceable. The numbering for songs in <i>The
Rake's Progress</i> is my own. Airs from both plays give us some
idea of the rich musical treasure English stagewriters could
draw upon for theatrical offerings in the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>

<h3>THE HARLOT'S PROGRESS</h3>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air I</i>: &quot;What tho I am a Country Lass&quot; is an eighteenth century
ballad by Martin Parker printed in <i>Orpheus Calendonius;
or, A Collection of Scots Songs Set to Music by
W[illiam] Thomson</i>, II (London 1733), p. 85. Its first two
lines are &quot;Although I be but a Country Lass/Yet a lofty
Mind I bear-a.&quot; It was used by Theophilus Cibber (as Air
XII) in his 1732 one-act version of Charles Coffey's <i>The
Devil to Pay</i> where the transformed cobbler's wife Nell
sings: &quot;Tho late I was a Cobler's Wife,/In cottage most obscure-a&quot;
(pp. 20-21). In <i>The Harlot's Progress</i>, this air, sung
by Madame Decoy, is clearly appropriate for seducing
Kitty-Moll into the world of bawds and prostitutes, with its
theme of magical change and the conquest of innocence by
vice.</p>

<p class="hangindent">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>[pg x]</span><i>Air II</i>: &quot;Brisk Tom and Jolly Kate&quot; is Air IX of Lacy Ryan's
<i>The Cobler's Opera</i> (London 1729), which has tunes by
Leveridge, Purcell, and others. The lyrics in Ryan's piece
allude to Bridewell: &quot;Pray; Sir, did I not give to you a
Passage free/When Hemp did threaten,&quot; (pp. 14-15).</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air III</i>: &quot;Maggy Lawther&quot; is a tune used by Theophilus Cibber
(Air IX) in <i>Patie and Peggy ... A Scotch Ballad Opera</i>
(London 1730), p. 10.</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air IV</i>: &quot;Oh! what Pleasures will abound&quot; is Air VII of Henry
Fielding's <i>The Lottery</i> (London 1732). Johann Pepusch
composed the music for this air in collaboration with
Lewis Theobald for the pantomime opera <i>Perseus and Andromeda</i>
(1730). Fielding's name for the tune was &quot;In Perseus
and Andromeda.&quot;</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air V</i>: &quot;Lads a Dunce.&quot; The music is preserved in British
Library Add. MS. 29371, fol. 30a, no. 45, and printed in
Fielding's <i>The Grub-Street Opera</i> as Air II (ed. Edgar V.
Roberts, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1968), p.
92. Its composer is not known.</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air VI</i>: &quot;Maidens fresh as a Rose&quot; appears as Air VI in
Ebenezer Forrest's ballad opera <i>Momus turn'd fabulist; or,
Vulcan's Wedding</i>, a work translated from the French of
Fuzelier and Le Grand (London 1729), p. 12. It also could
be the song in D'Urfey's <i>Wit and Mirth: or, Pills to Purge
Melancholy</i> (1719), with a slightly different title, &quot;Maiden
fresh as a Rose,&quot; though the syllabic pattern does not seem
to match: &quot;Young buxome and full of jollity,/Take no
Spouse among Beaux,&quot; (I, p. 57).</p>

<h3>THE RAKE'S PROGRESS</h3>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Airs I-III</i> are not traceable (&quot;From Virue's sluggish Rules be
free,&quot; &quot;Mary's Dream&quot; and &quot;Alteration&quot;).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi" id="pagexi"></a>[pg xi]</span></p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air IV</i>: &quot;Duett&quot; to the tune &quot;An Old Woman Cloathed in
Gray&quot; is the familiar first tune of John Gay's <i>The Beggar's
Opera</i>, ed. Edgar V. Roberts (Lincoln: University of
Nebraska Press, 1969), pp. 94-95.</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air V</i>: Van Butchel's song (&quot;See Martin dus his goods
display&quot;) is not in the songbooks. Prof. Roberts suggests
the lyrics could fit the music of &quot;Lillibullero,&quot; sometimes
used for songs in dialect. Henry Purcell wrote or arranged
this Irish burden which was used in 12 ballad operas, including
Fielding's <i>Don Quixote in England</i> (1733). Simpson
(p. 454) gives one example in dialect: &quot;By Creist my
dear Morish vat makes de sho'shad&quot; (ca. 1689).</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air VI</i>: &quot;Shelah O'Sudds&quot; (to the tune &quot;The Siege of Troy&quot;) is
not traceable.</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air VII</i>: &quot;Medley. Tune, 'Petition Poor Vulcan'&quot; is from
Charles Dibdin's burletta <i>Poor Vulcan!</i> (London 1778)
which begins: &quot;The humble prayer and petition/Of Vulcan,
who his sad condition&quot; (I, 1, p. 7).</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air VIII</i>: &quot;Tune. Hunting Chorus, 'Poor Vulcan'&quot; is the
&quot;Chorus and Air&quot; from Dibdin's <i>Poor Vulcan!</i> It begins:
&quot;Blacksmith: 'Strike, strike, ton, ton ton, ron'/Huntsman:
'Sound, Sound, tan, ran, ran, tan'&quot; (I, ii, p. 10).</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air IX</i>: &quot;Tune: 'Finale 1st act <i>Poor Vulcan!</i>'&quot; seems to be the
song &quot;Pike; 'Pooltroon! Damnation! Zounds, unhand me;/
Either you villain, eat that word,'&quot; (<i>Poor Vulcan!</i> I, p. 23).</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air X</i>: &quot;Medley. Tune, 'Black Joke'&quot; is Leveridge's song of
1730. See E. V. Roberts, ed. Henry Fielding, <i>The Grub-Street
Opera</i> (p. 105) and Charles Wood's <i>The Author's
Farce</i> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1966), p. 116.</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air XI</i>: &quot;Welcome, Brother Debtor&quot; appears in many
eighteenth-century song collections, including Henry

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air XVI</i>: &quot;Mind the Golden Rule&quot; is not identifiable.</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air XVII</i>: &quot;Tune 'Mary's Lamentation'&quot; is the old ballad (set
to the music of &quot;Crimson Velvet&quot;), the &quot;lamentable complaint&quot;
of Queen Mary for the &quot;unkind departure&quot; of
King Philip, &quot;in whose absence she fell sick, and died,&quot;
which begins &quot;Mary doth complain;/Ladies be you moved,&quot;
and appears in Richard Johnson's <i>Crown Garland of Roses</i>
(1659), ed. Chappell, 1895. Though popular in the seventeenth
century, it may have been written soon after Queen
Mary's death in 1558 (Simpson, p. 141). Verses similar to
Air XVII (&quot;I Sigh and lament me in vain,/These Walls can
but echo my moan,&quot;) appeared in Signior Giordani's
&quot;Queen Mary's Lamentation,&quot; printed in Domenico Corri's
<i>Select Collection</i> of 1779 (III, No. 71).</p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Air XX</i>: &quot;Ballad Tune: 'The Race Horse'&quot; with the title &quot;The
Rake's Progress.&quot; Thomas D'Urfey's tune is called &quot;The
Race Horse,&quot; and begins &quot;To Horse, brave Boys of
Newmarket, to Horse,&quot; and is &quot;set to an excellent Scotch
tune&quot; called &quot;Cock up thy Beaver&quot; (Simpson, p. 112). It
was first published with the music in D'Urfey's <i>Choice
New Songs</i> (1684) and appears as an untitled air in Kane
O'Hara's comic opera <i>Midas</i> (1764; ARS 167). It is also
called &quot;Newmarket,&quot; or &quot;Newmarket Horse Race,&quot; Air
XXII of the 1730 and 1750 versions of Fielding's <i>The Author's

<a href="#FNanchor_1_1">
<span class="label">[1]</span></a>
There are at least three dramatic pieces other than the <i>Theophilus Cibber</i>
work reprinted here which were inspired by William Hogarth's &quot;A
Harlot's Progress.&quot; Ronald Paulson reports one announced in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>
(13 November 1732) by Charlotte Charke entitled <i>The Harlot</i>. It
had been printed by Curll; but there is no record of performance (<i>Hogarth:
His Life, Art, and Times</i>, I, London and New Haven: Yale University Press,
1971, p. 290). Paulson also mentions the publication announcement in the
<i>Daily Advertiser</i> (5 February 1732/3) of: &quot;<i>The Decoy</i>, or <i>The Harlot's Progress</i>
(on February 14 called <i>The Jew Decoy'd</i>), a new ballad opera, said to
be performed at Goodman's Fields&quot; (p. 290). <i>The Jew Decoy'd</i>, a work
never performed and discussed at length by Robert E. Moore (<i>Hogarth's
Literary Relationships</i>, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota
Press, 1948, pp. 34-36) as being published in 1733, is a different
piece than <i>The Decoy; or, The Harlot's Progress, A
New Ballad Opera</i> [By Henry Potter] (<i>The London
Stage</i>, ed. Arthur Scouten, Part 3, Vol. I, Carbondale: Southern Illinois
University Press, 1962-68, pp. 269-270, abbreviated in later citations as &quot;<i>LS</i>&quot;
followed by part, volume and page number.) The title page of Potter's piece
reads: &quot;<i>The Decoy. An Opera. As it is Acted at the New Theatre in Goodman's
Fields</i>. London, 1733, with the &quot;Dedication&quot; signed by Potter. This
three-act piece contains 52 songs, three of which also appear in Cibber's
&quot;The Harlot's Progress.&quot; The &quot;Introduction&quot; alludes to Hogarth's series as
the source (&quot;the Sketch is now in Print&quot;), but it has many links to John
Gay's <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>, and, like Cibber's piece, only follows the first
three plates. Potter's small theater in the Haymarket opened in 1720 but no
organized company had produced legitimate drama there by 1728 (<i>LS</i>, 3, I,
cxxxix). The run was successful for Potter: he had a benefit on 8 February,
with the comment &quot;On account of the great Demand for Places, the Pit and
Boxes will be laid together at 5s each&quot; (<i>LS</i> 3, I, 270). Hogarth had advertised
the subscription for &quot;A Harlot's Progress&quot; as early as 8 March 1731.
(See Ronald Paulson, <i>Hogarth's Graphic Works</i>, I, Rev. Ed., New Haven
and London: Yale University Press, 1970, p. 141. Citations in my text are abbreviated
<i>HGW</i> followed by volume and page number.) This piece appears
in Baker's <i>Biographia Dramatica</i> (Vol. II, p. 157) without comment, while
he lists &quot;<i>The Jew Decoy'd; or The Progress of an Harlot</i>,&quot; 8vo. 1733 &quot;as
never being performed, but founded on the Hogarth series.&quot; <i>The Jew
Decoy'd</i> discussed by Moore has the title page: &quot;London: Printed for E:
Rayner ... 1733,&quot; published on 14 February (p. 34). The Henry E. Huntington
Library has a copy, &quot;Printed by W: Rayner ... 1735&quot; but does not
have the frontispiece Moore describes. For engravings, see Vol. II of
Paulson's <i>Hogarth's Graphic Works</i>.</p>

in &quot;<i>The Rake's Progress</i>: A New Dramatic Version of William Hogarth's
Prints,&quot; in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (October 1972), 381-383. The theatrical
career of the author, Theophilus Cibber (1703-1758), has not been fully
assessed. He did know Hogarth: they both belonged to John Rich's group,
the &quot;Sublime Society of Beef Steaks,&quot; which met in the scene-painting loft
over the Covent Garden stage. Cibber joined the group in September 1739,
and Hogarth was a charter member in 1735 (<i>HGW</i>, I, 188). Cibber himself
played an active role in the creation of the position of stage manager or
&quot;under-manager&quot; (<i>LS</i>, 3, I, xcvi).</p>

words by Congreve, music by Seedo and &quot;Compos'd by J. Weaver, Dancing-Master.&quot;

London Stage</i> entry for 31 March 1733 reads: &quot;John Banks's <i>The Albion
Queens</i> ... Also <i>The Harlot's Progress; or, the Triumph of Beauty</i>&quot; (<i>LS</i>, 3,
I, 283). Many actors and actresses doubled (e.g., Mrs. Raftor is one of the
&quot;Graces&quot; in the masque). No doubt the concluding &quot;Masque&quot; of <i>The
Harlot's Progress</i> is Weaver's piece (p. 12).</p>

<span class="label">[12]</span></a> Cibber's piece may have opened as early as 12 March 1733 in the pantomime
house at Sadler's Wells, which had been reconstructed from a seventeenth
century Music Room (see <i>LS</i>, 3, I, xxxix). Cibber's <i>The Harlot's Progress</i>
had a successful run at Drury Lane in the spring of 1733, from 31
March until 28 May, when the actor-manager dispute led to a closing of the
playhouse (see <i>LS</i>, 3, I, 304). It played as an afterpiece to such works
as <i>Cato</i> and <i>The Provok'd Husband</i>, and on 26 April a playbill
announced the &quot;Royal Family expected to attend&quot; (<i>LS</i>, 3, I, 293).
Thereafter it had a career at the fairs, beginning with the Lee-Harper-Petit
Booth on Tottenham Court on 30 August 1733 (<i>LS</i>, 3, I, 310), moving on 23
August to Bartholomew Fair and on 28 September to Mile End Green,
where the harlot's name is listed as &quot;Moll Hackabout&quot; (<i>LS</i>, 3, I, 321). On 27
October 1733 it had a command performance at Drury Lane (<i>LS</i>, 3, I, 330).
It played frequently during that winter and in the spring, on 26 April, the
seceding actors returned to Drury Lane to perform in <i>The Conscious
Lovers</i> and <i>The Harlot's Progress</i>. The cast list is the same as that in the
text reprinted here (<i>LS</i>, 3, I, 390). The successful run continued through
October 1734; after that it was only played a couple of times before the 1736
season (<i>LS</i>, 3, I, <i>passim</i>). Scouten observes: &quot;a remarkable feature&quot; is that
this piece &quot;places a Jewish merchant in a favorable light, treating him not
with sympathy but with respect as a pillar of trade&quot; (<i>LS</i>, 3, I, xcvi).</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
